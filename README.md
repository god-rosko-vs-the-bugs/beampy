# beampy
A tool to create quickly beamer presentations

Give it a folder with inner structure:

    test
    ├── 1
    ├── 10
    ├── 2
    ├── 3
    ├── 4
    ├── 5
    ├── 6
    ├── 7
    ├── 8
    ├── 9
    └── images
        ├── image1
        ├── image2
        └── image3

where  1 to 10 (works with arbitrary numbers) are slides and contain what they have to
and the images folder you need if you refference images
just so you can do that with relative paths for speed
